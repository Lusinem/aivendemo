This is a very basic implementation dedicated some 2-3 hours.
I have no experience with reactive programming, and especially no react.js experience.
I understand the handling of the implementation would have been completely different, in case applied react.
Application considers only happy path, the possible failures we can discuss further.
I have implemented only region selection via cloud provider part, for calculating geolocation, unfortunately I don't have time.

In frontend also some styles are missing, like selected region etc.

You need java 11+
To start the application call you need ./mvnw spring-boot:run  -> localhost:8080
